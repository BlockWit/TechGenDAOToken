## Overview
Interaction with the smart contract is provided by calling smart contract functions with parameters.  
* First, you need to find out the `address` of the smart contract.
* With the address, you can get the `ABI interface`.
* Using the `ABI` you can call the target `function` of the smart contract.

## Obtaining the ABI interface

1. Go to the [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io).
2. Enter smart contract address in the field `Search by address` and click `Search` button.
3. Go to the `Contract` section.

4. Click `Code` button

>Attention! Carefully check the entered data Before clicking `write` button. Sometimes the data format differs from the usual presentation.

## How to whitelist addresses
The CommonSale contract has two methods for whitelisting addresses:
* addToWhiteList - to add exactly one address to whitelist. Reverts if address is already whitelisted.
* addToWhiteListMultiple - this function takes an array as input. Allows you to add multiple addresses in one transaction.
>Only owner of the smart contract can call service functions.

1. To add multiple addresses follow steps 1-4 of the [Calling function](#calling-function) section.
2. Fill `Targets` field. We recommend passing at most 100-200 addresses per function call. Addresses should be enclosed in square brackets, separated by commas. Each address must be enclosed in quotes.

## How to withdraw tokens from freezeWallet
The FreezeWallet contract releases 2,100,000 tokens each 90 days.
In order to get released tokens [team wallet owner](https://etherscan.io/address/0x44c4a8d57b22597a2c0397a15cf1f32d8a4ea8f7) should [call](#calling-function) `retrieveWalletTokens` function with the target address passed as a parameter.
You can specify any address as `target` for receiving tokens.

## How to read contract information using Etherscan
Another way to read and smart contract information is to use interface provided by [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io).  
The first steps are similar to those described in the section [Obtaining the ABI interface](#obtaining-the-abi-interface):
1. Go to the [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io).
2. Enter smart contract address in the field `Search by address` and click `Search` button.
3. Go to the `Contract` section.
4. Click `Read Contract` button. Now you can access contract's public information. You don't need to create a transaction to `read` the contract.
